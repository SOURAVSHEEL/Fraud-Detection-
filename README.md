## Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset comprises user, transaction, and card information, along with fraud labels for supervised learning.

## Dataset
Transaction Data: Contains transaction amounts, types, and timestamps.
Card Data: Includes card types, limits, and activation dates.
User Data: Customer demographics and account information.

## Objective
Build a predictive model to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## Implementation
Data Exploration: Understand and visualize data relationships.
Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features from raw data.
Model Training: Train classification models to detect fraud.
Evaluation: Assess performance using Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC.
